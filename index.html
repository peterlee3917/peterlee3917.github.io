                  I am conducting a research study on the correlation between HIV/AIDS prevalence and 
                  orphan cases in Zimbabwe, using LSTM models and linear regression 
                  to analyze historical data and enable accurate time series forecasting of future orphan cases 
                  due to HIV/AIDS. I plan to analyze trends in line with policies enacted during specific years 
                  and detect the most effective programs that have been effective in reducing orphan and HIV/AIDS 
                  rates. I plan to then conduct a strategic and targeted fundraiser to allocate towards the optimal 
                  program, hosting DJing concerts in and outside the US to raise funds for Chiedza, a cluster-randomised 
                  trial that studies the impact of community-based integrated HIV services on youth in Zimbabwe.

                <p class="work-text">
                  After conducting 750+ B2C online forums across the Bellevue School District to measure public 
                  demands for creative avenues and consulting with struggling and upcoming cultural stakeholders 
                  to measure their challenges in thriving in an underfunded art & culture sector, we noticed a 
                  surging demand for musical and live performances. Partnering with the City of Bellevue to construct 
                  Eastside Live, a digital calendar for such stakeholders to increase creative exposure to their events 
                  to educational districts in the Pacific Coast, we then incorporated both community and partner feedback 
                  to "The Playhouse," a major, cross-cultural arts and gathering facility at the crossroads of the new Downtown 
                  Bellevue. My ability to understand people in scale through diverse data collection techniques and focus group 
                  conversations allowed us to enhance the venue’s architectural appeal and operational strategies, resulting in 
                  the capacity to host up to 300 annual events and further optimizing the use of a $45M budget provided by large 
                  development agencies.

                <p class="work-text">
                  Alongside a team of three masters and PhD students, I developed a strategic codebook for analyzing media coverage of 
                  alternative programs to school resource officers (SROs) across the US, streamlining hundreds of thousands of sources 
                  into a dataset of 410 relevant articles. Manually reading through each, I extracted and categorized major characteristics, 
                  definitions, and terms associated with SRO alternatives, searching by common key words to determine the effectiveness of 
                  SRO programs and if other alternatives were better in enhancing student academic performance and social behavior in their 
                  school environments.

                  </h3>
                  <p class="article-text">
                    I am from a small suburban city outside Seattle where I attended Interlake High School. From the age of nine, I began learning how to create visual art, which taught me the subjective nature of design in understanding both myself and others. My creative foundation led me to urban planning & development - from innovating physical design products and digital platforms to optimize urban transitions into local architecture to analyzing data to assess the impact of policies on target populations.

                  <p class="article-text">
                    For the next few years, I continued conducting research projects that revolve around economic and political development, understanding the catalysts behind trends to develop scalable solutions that addressed both individual and organizational challenges. The hybrid of collecting and understanding data whilst independently creating solutions became my passion, drawing me towards the creation of authentic "user experiences" and a sharp understanding of B2C dynamics.

                  <p class="article-text">
                    Now, I study Economics at Stanford University and am the founder of Artellect Co., where we are trying to uncover the roots of customer trust and loyalty, redefining corporate art as leverage for companies to better connect with their customers through a nostalgic and youthful brand image. I'm always open to connecting—feel free to reach out!
